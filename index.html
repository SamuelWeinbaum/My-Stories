        <h1>My Stories</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">One time, while I was chatting with my sister Hinda Leah, 
            I was telling her one of my stories. She says, "Your stories are always so 
            interesting and well-told; you should write them down. I would read them, and I am sure 
            many others would be very interested too." So the next day, boom! I have a website of just some of my stories. I hope to add many more soon.
            as I live my life. I hope you enjoy!</p>

            <h2>The Tap Tap</h2>
            <p>One time, when I was at McGill, I went to a place called Hillel, which was basically like Chabad McGill. I went there one Friday night to chill, eat, and talk to girls. Practice, at least. Nothing much, just chat. I got pretty good at riz. Anyway, there I am talking to two girls, and they both love me. I'm chatting with them about whatever, and it's just about time to leave.</p>
            <p>I give a goodbye hug to the first girl, and the second girl says, "Ooo, I want a hug too." So I'm like, "Hihi, suuureee." I give her a hug, and then I make a mistake. My right hand goes around her and gives her two light taps on the back.</p>
            <p>Now, what does that mean? It means friendship! Damn, I think I just friendzoned myself. Ooooff. Anyway, I take a step back and smile, like, "Haha, so nice to chat with you, lalala," while all the while I'm thinking, Damn, what in God's name did I do? Tap tap? How could I have done that? Ooops.</p>
            <p>They leave, and all is well. I go over to my friends, and they're all chatting about some random thing as they always are. There's this other girl sitting there, a little older than me. I get the sense that she wouldn't be interested anyway, so I might as well just friendzone myself from the start.</p>
            <p>I turn to her and say, "Hey yoo, I think I just screwed up. I just double-tapped this girl on the back. Doesn't that mean friendzoned?"</p>
            <p>She stares at me for a second and goes, "What? No, why would it?"</p>
            <p>"Because you only double-tap friends, not a girl you like."</p>
            <p>"That’s ridiculous," she says, shaking her head, and then she turns to all my friends to ask them. Three minutes later, she's full-on arguing with them about it, completely involved, while I’m just there riling her up. Haha.</p>
            <p>Then, somehow, it comes up that she’s actually the cousin of my friend Gad. I find that hard to believe, but it kind of makes sense. They look alike—both of them were Sfarad. But just before we’re about to leave, Gad gives it away that they’re pulling my leg.</p>
            <p>I’m like, Ooff, what?!</p>
            <p>So I head up the stairs to find her and confront her about it. I wait on the steps for about 20 seconds, and then I see her heading down with her friends, putting on her coat. Four steps from the bottom, I say, "You lied, dammmmmnit! Haha. I totally thought you were related."</p>
            <p>She laughs and says, "Ohhh haha, yeeee, gotcha."</p>
            <p>We take three steps down, and I go, "Alright, well, it was nice to get to know ya. Bye!"</p>
            <p>I lean in for the hug, and she leans over. Tap tap. =)</p>

            <h2>1/e: A story to my grandmother</h2>
            <p>Hello, Granny! It's been well over a month since I last sent you an email, so I thought it's well overdue to send you another. Some wonderful things have happened to me recently. The first is that I got into McGill, which you already know. I've already signed up for all my classes, and they look pretty interesting. I've also looked up my teachers and found that they are very intriguing people. One of them is an astrophysicist, and another is a particle physicist. The nice thing about my teachers is that they are currently doing research in their fields, which is very different from college where the teachers have sort of given up. I'm very excited to see how much I can learn from these people. I'm taking five classes. Three of the subjects I believe I already know, but two of the classes will be brand new to me, and I hope I learn a lot from those. Anyway, the whole thing has turned out ideal, so we'll see how everything goes from here.</p>
            <p>The other nice thing that happened to me was that I made a great discovery. The story goes like this: about a month ago, I was doing my nightly exercises while also listening to my favorite mathematician, William Dunham (the one whose books Mommy bought me, and I believe I told you about in a previous email). He was being interviewed by a statistician who spoke to him about probability. William brought up a nice fact that the mathematician Leonard Euler discovered about probability. The problem was: if you have a certain number of cups, each one containing one ball, and then you were to mix all the balls and put them in different cups at random, what is the chance that all the balls are in a different cup from where they started? Immediately when I heard this, I paused the video because I wanted to solve the problem on my own. Well, I went to bed, and the next night, while I was falling asleep, I tried to solve the problem, but I didn't get very far.</p>
            <p>About a week later, I was at McGill with my friend, and I told him about this problem. He began to do the problem in his head while speaking aloud, and we tried to solve the problem together. Well, our ideas didn’t work very well, so we left it at that. Then, finally, I went to Six Flags LaRonde and met up with my friend again, and he said that he had solved it and had come up with a formula. What the formula does is it takes in the number of cups and then tells you the probability for that number of cups. Obviously, the probability depends on the number of cups since if you just had one cup and one ball, the probability is zero since no matter how you mix up the cup and the ball, the ball always ends up where it started. So the probability that all the balls are in a different cup from where they started is zero. While for two cups, the probability is a half since half the time both balls are back where they started, and half the time both balls are in different cups from where they started.</p>
            <p>Anyway, the next morning I tried to work on the problem, and it took me about four or five hours until I finally came up with the formula. I ran home all excited and called up my friend, and I told him my formula, and lo and behold, it was the same formula. So we both solved that problem. Now, this wasn't what was amazing. What was amazing was that we noticed that if you have more and more cups and more and more balls, the probability that all the balls are in a different cup from where they started after being mixed approaches about 36.1756753376%... that is if you have 100 cups the probability is 36.1% but with 1000 cups the probability is 36.17% and so on approaching 36.1756753376%...</p>
            <p>Well, I was intrigued by this since I wanted to know what number this was. What is this number that the probability is approaching? In order to tell you what the answer was, you must first know about the number "e," which is just 2.717... This number is just like pi (3.14); it's just a very famous number. Well, I went back to work, and I found that as you have more and more cups and more and more balls, the probability approaches 1/e. Well, I was ecstatic since it was such a simple and elegant answer. I was jumping around the kitchen going, "Woo-hoo!" I finally decided to watch the end of the video, which I hadn't completed. I rewatched the part where he explains the problem, and right after where I paused it, he continues and says, "And the Great mathematician Leonard Euler showed that the probability approaches 1/e as the number of cups gets larger and larger." Well, I hadn't heard this before, and that was a wonderful thing since he was complimenting the great Leonard Euler for having discovered such a wonderful fact, and I had discovered it too.</p>
            <p>The next morning, I looked it up on Wikipedia, and everything I did was already there, which didn't bother me at all since the point was that I discovered it, not that it hadn't been discovered already. But I found that my formula was there and some other things that I discovered, so I really did solve the problem. Just last night when I told my friend the solution, he said my solution was mind-blowing, and how the heck did I think of it? Well, that's the second thing that happened to me. It was quite fun and quite an experience. Life is going pretty well for me at the moment.</p>
            <p>I heard you're coming in August. I can't wait. How are things working out on your end?</p>
            <p>Love you Granny.</p>
            <p>Can’t wait to see!</p>

            <h2>Drifting with an Engineer</h2>
            <p>About five years ago now, and something I did and still do often, was go and take long walks, listening to heavy classical music like Bach. One time, it was right in the middle of winter, about 9 pm, and there was a mad blizzard. Anyway, I get the urge to go out and listen, wash away my feelings in music. So I get the car, and the air is freezing—like when you can see your breath and the steering wheel is freezing off your fingers.</p>
            <p>I go up the mountain, around the back, find parking, and it's pitch black. The wipers are going left-right reaaaal fast. I turn on my crappy little iPod off-brand thing that I got from a friend. I didn’t have a phone ‘cause, well, I didn’t believe in them. Anyway, so I unravel the iPod wire with 10 knots, plug it in, pass it through my coat, under my zipper, coming up through the neck hole. And boom—music.</p>
            <p>It’s real crazy. The Bach is on max, and the blizzard is insane. The lights are just from the lamp posts. It’s really cool. So I’m walking up there, and there isn’t another soul. I’m walking through the forest, and finally, I start getting closer to the long path that leads to the viewpoint. And there, at the end of the path, I see this guy figure—a shadow. What the heck? Why is someone up here now?</p>
            <p>Well, I get closer to him and say, “Hey.” We both can’t see each other’s faces ‘cause of the muffs. So he takes off his, and he’s this young Asian guy. I take off my muff and go, “What are you doing up here?” He goes, “What are you?” Then he asks what school I go to. At the time, I was going to TAV, or maybe it was even before that. I wasn’t going to say, “Oh yeah, I go to TAV,” some crappy off brand school, or, “I’m not in school.”</p>
            <p>So instead, I go, “Oh, I’m in McGill!” (True now, though.) He goes, “No way. I’m there too. I’m studying electrical engineering.”</p>
            <p>“Damn! That’s so cool!”</p>
            <p>We talked a bit and it turns out, he plays the violin. And yeah, we walk to the viewpoint and talk about music. Then, on the way back to the parking lot, he starts explaining to me all about nanochips and how they’re made. That was pretty cool. Well, here I was at 11 at night, walking with a complete stranger—an electrical engineer—up the mountain in a blizzard. Haha. Cool.</p>
            <p>My car was on the other side of the mountain, so when we got closer to his car, which was in the parking lot, he goes, “Hey, you want a lift?” So I think, Mmm, don’t know him. But he’s like maybe two years older, and he doesn’t seem like the kidnapping type. So I go, “Sure!”</p>
            <p>We get to his car, and it’s nice—a white Lexus. I get in, and he goes, “Hey! You wanna drift?”</p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>He says, “You know, like the car donuts!”</p>
            <p>“Oh... Sure, yeah, that would be fun!”</p>
            <p>And the car goes, “Vrrrrruuuummmmm!” and suddenly I’m being pulled to the right as the car does a drift in a huge circle on the icy ground of the parking lot. No other cars were there, obviously. Something kept beeping—some sort of brake light skidding beeping warning. So yeah, here I was now drifting up the mountain with an unknown engineer in a blizzard! Hihi!</p>
            <p>We talk some more, and then we head to my car. He goes, “Hey, you got Insta?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, sure!”</p>
            <p>At that time, I was very against YouTube and phones and how they’re all wasting people’s time. And here is the guy responsible for making it, haha. He’s an electrical engineer who designs phone chips! So I go, “Hey, you yadayada! Phones are bad!” And he goes, “Oh yeah, I see what you mean. I try not to use this stuff too much.”</p>
            <p>I go, “Yeah, but do you not care that others yadayada?”</p>
            <p>He goes, “Meh! It’s their choice! And I make money, so whatever!”</p>
            <p>I go, “Mmm, okay! I guess it is, and I guess you do!”</p>
            <p>And I get out. =)</p>

            <h2>The Mayans</h2>
            <p>About three years ago, I was at the peak of my cult-like admiration for Feynman. I loved physics, and he was someone in the field who was very fun and intriguing. I read all of his books. I spent hours in the library downtown, called La Grande Bibliothèque, looking for more and more obscure books on him. I found ones written by his daughter, ones on his art, and a bunch of others.</p>
            <p>Anyway, in his main book, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman, he talks about how he got super interested in the Mayans of South America. He was apparently there for his honeymoon, climbing up and down pyramids, and one time in a gift shop, he found a copy of the Dresden Codex, one of the three books left over from the ancient Mayans. The rest were burned by the crusaders as "devil stuff." He got interested in trying to decode it and apparently made a big discovery about the periods of Venus.</p>
            <p>So I’m reading all this stuff, and I read Feynman say, "You gotta make your own adventure. You’re not gonna find it on the highway—you gotta walk on the side in the dirt. That’s where you’ll find adventure."</p>
            <p>I was 19, super excited with stuff, and one day I’m sitting at the piano, playing, thinking about the Mayans and Feynman, and I get this idea. I gotta go see a Mayan temple! I gotta go to Mexico!</p>
            <p>I grabbed the phone and called the one friend I knew who was interested in Feynman too. I don’t remember now, but we’d been friends for at least two years by then and had talked about math, physics, and Feynman for at least a year. We were already on the same page. He picked up, and I said, "Listen, I just got the best idea. We should go to a Mayan temple in Mexico just because Feynman did. No other reason. It would be fun as hell and crazy, just like Feynman’s philosophy. We gotta!"</p>
            <p>He was a bit unsure, so I said, "Listen, in 90 years, when you’re looking back on life, do you want to have gone to Mexico, exploring random caves and temples? Not the tourist ones but the real ones, in the middle of nowhere?" He said, "Yeah!" And so that’s how it all started.</p>
            <p>A few weeks later, I’m at the library, La Grande Bibliothèque, and I go over to the computer and search "Maya." Twenty results. Off I go....floor 3, then 2, then 4. And then I found a shelf full of them. I grabbed two baskets and filled them to the brim. I took every single Mayan book.</p>
            <p>Funny thing is, I grew a taste for the Mayans. They started to seem familiar, so when I saw, right next to them, the Aztecs, I was like, "Oooof, who the heck are those weird people? Nonono, I want Mayans, haha."</p>
            <p>I took out all 20 Mayan books and had to carry them home in two heavy-duty bags. I felt proud, but I probably looked more like a lunatic—sitting in the metro with 20 books, and not small ones, huge heavy textbooks. I got home, spread them all over my bed, and thought, "Aaaahhh, so nice." I spent that night reading about Mayan culture.</p>
            <p>Over the days, I slowly learned more and more and shared my ideas with my friend. We both got pretty psyched about the Mayans, and they became a bit of a hobby for us. We decided to go in the summer, so we had a long time to plan.</p>
            <p>As the days got closer, we got more serious about figuring out exactly where and what we’d do. My friend, Gershon, said we should go to Cancun. The idea was to get to Chichén Itzá—our goal. All that mattered was getting to that temple. The trip didn’t matter, the places or the beds didn’t matter. What mattered was getting to that temple.</p>
            <p>Anyway, Gershon said the best way would be Cancun. But I was like, "No way. It’s way too touristy. The whole point is to go against the norm, to be crazy! To sleep in the dirt and walk in the mud." So I really wanted to start from the other side: Mérida.</p>
            <p>We disagreed for a day or two. But then, one time in the shower, I was thinking to myself, "What the heck? Why am I being so serious about this?" So I called him up, ready to say, "You know what, let’s do it your way." But just before I opened my mouth, he said, "You know what? Let’s do it your way!"</p>
            <p>Well! Okay then! So we planned our trip from Merida. We would first fly to Mexico City, then to Merida, using the city as a sort of home base. There were two or three sites near the city on the outskirts, about 3 to 4 hours away. We planned to visit those, then, on the fourth day, head to a little town in the middle of the Yucatan Peninsula called Piste. We’d stay in a small inn there, or just ask a local if there weren’t any. Chichen Itza was only a 20-minute walk from Piste. Afterward, we’d return to Merida, spend a day or two, and then head home. It was a perfect plan.</p>
            <p>Once, I got the idea to make T-shirts expressing our "religious" views on Feynman. Haha. I found a place in the Peel metro station that let you design custom T-shirts. I made two with Feynman’s big smiling face on them and text straight from the Mayan Dresden Codex, page 16. Right in the middle, in big letters, I wrote "Feynmanism." I felt pretty proud coming home, haha.</p>
            <p>The next day was programming class with Ahad, a super nice but lazy teacher. Often, when you came into his class at 9 am, he’d be sitting there, not even realizing class had started. He’d spend most of the time explaining something you could figure out in five minutes. But no one was complaining, so it was fine. That morning, as usual, Gershon walked in 25 minutes late with his slow morning walk—classic by now! I had left the T-shirt and a book about the Mayans on his chair. He loved it. I said, "You’ve got to read the book, man. You can’t go to Mexico without knowing anything about the Mayans!" He reluctantly agreed.</p>
            <p>Finally, it was time to go. His father picked me up, and we headed to the airport. I started talking to him about the math I was learning at the time—something about measure zero and Lebesgue measure. It was new to me, and I was trying to explain how measure-zero functions are integrable with the Riemann integral. At the airport, Gershon said, "I can’t believe we’re doing this. This is crazy. Why are we doing this?" We were both wearing our Feynmanism T-shirts, off to the Yucatan Peninsula to see one temple in the middle of the jungle, inspired by some physics guy who climbed temples on his honeymoon. It was crazy, but we loved it.</p>
            <p>First things first: piano! I knew there were a couple in the airport. After finding our gate, I went to locate one. On my way, a guy saw my shirt and said, "Hey, that’s Feynman!" At the piano, I played to impress the crowd. Some people watched, others didn’t. Meh, not everyone appreciates live music. Finally, we boarded the plane. I had learned enough Spanish online to get by, so I was ready to "preguntar para un taxi."</p>
            <p>On the plane, I remember doing some analysis, and my friend was too, so we talked and studied. I watched a movie or something—don’t remember exactly. We landed in Mexico City and then got onto a little plane. I’d been talking to Gershon about how I wanted to sit next to a pretty girl and get stuck with her. Well, I got what I wanted—sort of. On the second flight, I got stuck with an overweight, short Mexican woman, and Gershon laughed as I barely had enough room to put my right arm.</p>
            <p>We landed and started walking to the baggage claim, and then it hit me—I was the tallest person on the plane. Every man was at least two heads shorter. We started joking about Mexicans a lot. We called them Juan. The jokes began: How many Mexicans does it take to change a light bulb? Juan. How do Mexicans do a roll call? Juan, Juan, Juan…… Oh, and soccer. Can you imagine? Juan passes to Juan. Oooh no, Juan steals the ball!! Wait, wait, Carlóóós?? Hahaha.</p>
            <p>We got out of the airport, and it was hot! Gershon called an Uber—or there it might have been called something else. He couldn’t come into the airport! What? Apparently, only official taxis are allowed in, and everyone else has to pick up from outside. Ooof. So we began to walk, and the heat was a lot. It was nice though—there were palm trees and grass, and it wasn’t shabby. Pretty modern, I guess. We finally got to a corner, and the Uber car said it was just there. We found it, and I turned to Gershon. In a very serious voice, I said, “Take a picture of his license plate and send it to your mom!” He goes, “Why?” and I get all serious. “Bro, we don’t know this guy. What if something happens?” “Okay, okay, fine!”</p>
            <p>He drove us straight to the apartment we had reserved online. “Thank you, gracias! Cuánto?” Something like 4 bucks for a 35-minute drive. Ooo, nice! Okay! The apartment was nice. Problem was—one bed! Gershon says it’s fine, we’ll just split it in the middle with pillows. But I go, “Hell naa!” and begin making myself a pillow fort where I would sleep for the rest of the stay! First things first—sleep. That was nearly 20 hours of traveling, and we needed it. So we pulled down the shades in the hot sun and slept.</p>
            <p>We got up at about 3 pm, having arrived at 7 am. What to do? Well, I wanted to see the Mayans. I came all the way here to see them. But first, we needed food and groceries, so out we went walking. There was apparently a pizza store a couple of blocks away. We passed by a landmark I saw on Google Earth Street View, and I got all excited. We took a selfie, and then there was a lemon tree. I thought, “Hey, how much would you pay me if I ate this lemon?” “Bruh?” I took a bite, and oh my god. “My mouth is numb.” Gershon started to laugh, but I was not. “I’m serious. What the heck? My mouth tingles.”</p>
            <p>We kept walking as I swished my tongue around, trying to feel if my lips were still there. We made it to the pizza store. It was okay, kind of okay. But they had other stuff too, like waffles, which looked good, but for another time. It was getting late—nearly 5, and things were starting to close, so we decided to just go for it. There was a museum 25 minutes away by car, all about the Mayans. An Uber or similar car picked us up, and I said in my broken but working Spanish, “Ehh, queremos irnos al museo aquí,” and I showed him Gershon’s phone. “Ahh, sí sí!” and off we went.</p>
            <p>We got there just in time. We were the last people allowed to enter. It was really cool, full of interesting artifacts and stuff. Bones and vessels. Apparently, they were enslaved or mistreated by the colonists, and that was the whole point of the museum. Sort of interesting, but through the eyes of a Feynmanist? Hell yeah, everything was amazing!!! There was a room with a video screen and a deep Spanish voice talking about “los Mayans antiguos.” At the end, there was a guide or a guy associated with the museum, and we got into a conversation about the Mayans. Apparently, he was very interested in them too and worked studying their language. And best of all? He was a Mayan! Our first! We were very happy to meet him, and I think we took a photo with him. The museum was closing, so it was time to go.</p>
            <p>We needed groceries. There was a grocery supermarket not far, just a 5-minute walk, so we headed over. We got ice cream and a big baguette, as well as a lot of pasta fusilli. I went over to Gershon and said, “We need noodles.” And Gershon goes, “What the? Noodles? That’s pasta!” Well, this turned into something bigger. Eventually, after the trip and back at home, we argued even more and brought in all our TAV friends too. It seems I got the name from my family and my mom, British, but it might just be a family thing. Who knows! Anyway, pasta! Noodles!</p>
            <p>We also got a bunch of other stuff, one big winner, and something I don’t remember anymore. Well, we left the grocery store, and it was getting dark. Gershon said, “Should we call an Uber?”</p>
            <p>“Nono, let’s walk and explore.”</p>
            <p>So, with a baguette in one hand and ice cream slowly melting in the other, we walked right on the main highway. Darkness was falling. We were in the middle of a weird city in the middle of the Yucatan Peninsula with no family or friends for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p>
            <p>On the walk, we saw some interesting things. On the top of the walls of some houses and sheds, they put broken glass from bottles to act as barbed wire. I thought it was funny how evil it looked. Jeeess, man, what a way to get hurt! Broken bottles of glass. Oooof.</p>
            <p>We walked for 5 hours. Passing everything in the city! We walked the entire city that night! We passed a Mayan car shop and took a selfie because of the word Mayan. We passed some tough guys who looked at us as we were looking at them with strange interest. But they seemed a bit scarier, at least at that hour and place.</p>
            <p>Finally, we made it all the way home. 11 at night. Walking in the neighborhood of the apartment where we were staying, there were barking dogs everywhere, and we howled back at them, “Awooooo!”</p>
            <p>Once we got home, booff! We went straight off to bed. Day 1.</p>
